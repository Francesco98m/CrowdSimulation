# CrowdSimulation
Unibo project

Just a simple project that should simulate people motion in editable 2D spaces

class boid is the one that creates every person
class obstacle is needed to create obstacles (Wow, such unexpected)

class quadrant is needed to reduce the computation, alias improve the efficiency of the programme

//still to do:
//Quadrant, event driven logic (?), add intelligence to people, pressure
